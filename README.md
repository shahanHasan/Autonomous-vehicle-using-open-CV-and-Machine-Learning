*This is my final year project*

## Abstract : 

The proposition of the project undertaken is to design, develop and implement an RC car employing a Raspberry pi (Computer), 
deep convoluted neural networks and SLAM. The objective is to successfully employ the concept of behaviour cloning within the 
field of vehicle operation exercising miscellaneous computer vision algorithms alongside concepts like Machine learning. 
A single front facing camera have been used, images from which will be passed onto the Supervised CNN to retrieve predicted 
steering commands. The proposed model is an illustration of supervised learning.

The report simply explains the entire developmental process of the project. The resolution of the project would be to 
demonstrate a computer algorithm operating a vehicle with human like precision. This will be done by employing deep 
end to end convoluted neural networks model proposed by NVidia (Karol Zieba NVIDIA Corporation, 2016), open source 
computer vision library known as open cv, and an RC car with raspberry pi and a driver board. The NVidia CNN model 
is able to generalize and obtain abstract models of different road features from within any image with almost human 
like precision with just one input parameter.

SLAM algorithms make use of LIDAR sensor, which will be the lesser focus of the project. SLAM algorithms 
are generally applied to retrieve a map of the environment; the vehicle is being driven into simultaneously 
localising itself within that map. An extended version of the Kalman filter is applied to the LIDAR data to acquire the map. 
Different objects located within the environment are also positioned within the map recovered.
